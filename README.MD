# House Prices Prediction Project

## Project Description  
This project focuses on predicting house prices using different machine learning models. We preprocess the data, apply feature engineering, train models, and evaluate their performance using RMSE.

## Files and Structure  
- `house_prices_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
- `train.csv` – Dataset containing house features and sale prices.  
- `test.csv` – Test dataset for final predictions.  
- `submission.csv` – Final predicted house prices.  
- `README.md` – Project documentation.
